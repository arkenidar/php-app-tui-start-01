## 🚀 Quick Start

### Start the Fiber Web Server

```bash
# Start the high-performance Fiber web server
cd server
php server-http-isolated.php

# Server runs on http://127.0.0.1:8001
# Visit http://127.0.0.1:8001/performance-monitor.php for live demo
```

### Run Comprehensive Demo

```bash
# Interactive demonstration of all features
./demo.sh
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Complete test suite with isolation verification
./server/run_tests.sh

# Quick validation
./server/validate.sh
```

## 📋 Requirements

- PHP 8.1+ with Fiber support
- Linux/macOS/Windows
- curl, jq, bc (for testing)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

- **IsolatedWebServer** - Main Fiber-based server with request isolation
- **RequestContext** - Per-request isolation environment
- **HttpRequest** - HTTP parsing and validation
- **Session Manager** - Isolated in-memory session storage

### Request Isolation Flow

```
Multiple Concurrent Requests → Fiber per Request → Isolated Context → PHP Script → Independent Response
```
